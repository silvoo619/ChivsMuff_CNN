# ChivsMuff_CNN
This project explores the development of Convolutional Neural Network for image classification from the public dataset Muffins vs Chihuahuas. Specifically, several models and their performances are compared. Then, the influences of data aug-
mentation and hyperparameter tuning are examined. In the last step, the risk of the best performing models is estimated by 5-fold cross-validation.
